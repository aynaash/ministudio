## 🎭 Case Study 1: ContextBytes Brand Story
> **Vision**: High-End Studio Ghibli x Shinkai Awe  
> **Script**: `examples/contextbytes_brand_story.py`

### 🎞️ The Production Specs
- **Characters**: Emma (Ghibli Heroine), David (Intellectual), The Orb.
- **Narrative**: A 48s journey from data-overload to cognitive mastery.
- **Aesthetic**: Deep teals (#008080) transitioning to Master Gold (#D4AF37).

### 📝 The Script (Logic)
```python
# Scene: The Bloom
ShotConfig(
    environment=GHIBLI_ATELIER,
    action="Glowing vines of bioluminescent data grow like vines around the desk."
)
```

### 🎬 The Result

### 🔍 Technical Debrief
- **Character Consistency**: **SUCCESS**. Identity Grounding 2.0 kept Emma's facial features stable across 6 shots.
- **Visual Drift**: **CHALLENGE**. Minor color shade shifts in Emma's sweater (Blue → Dark Blue) during lighting transitions.
- **Environment Sync**: **CHALLENGE**. High-frequency details in backgrounds (bookshelves) shimmered slightly in wide shots.

## 🧬 Case Study 2: The Last Algorithm
> **Vision**: Sci-Fi Narrative Tracking  
> **Script**: `examples/complex_story_demo.py`

### 🎞️ The Production Specs
- **Characters**: Sarah (Researcher), Aria (AI Hologram).
- **Narrative**: High-stakes lab breakout under glitching conditions.
- **Aesthetic**: Cinematic Night Lab transitioning to Crimson Alarm.

### 📝 The Script (Logic)
```python
# Sarah: focused → shocked → fearful
SARAH.current_state={"expression": "fearful"}
```

### 🎬 The Result
👉 **[Watch the Full Narrative on hersi.dev](https://www.hersi.dev/blog/ministudio)**

### 🔍 Technical Debrief
- **Temporal Stability**: **CHALLENGE**. Sarah's movement during the 'fearful' transition had minor jitter between keyframes.
- **Audio-Video Alignment**: **CHALLENGE**. Google TTS Studio-O voice finished 0.5s before the cinematic fade-out.

## 🛠️ Roadmap: AI Filmmaking 2.0

To move beyond the current "AI Ceiling," we are implementing the following in our next sprint:

1.  **Semantic Masking**: Lock the background geometry while animating only the character layers.
2.  **Audio-Driven Intensity**: Mapping the TTS waveform frequency to the diffusion model's motion intensity.
3.  **Global Seed Locking**: Using a deterministic random seed across an entire scene for zero color drift.
